= Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT)

- What do we want identifications of type equality to be eliminated to? This implies a new type former not just Id but overloaded with the same type constructor
- naively isomorphisms or bimaps
- its too strong that only HProp can satisfy
- we then weaken it with Voevodsky definition of equivalence as contractible fibres
